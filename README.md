Components
=====================
The Arudino and a Vibration motor sit inside the controller, with a joystick to control the movement. 
The added input for the controller that the ghost can now perform is to return to the middle with the button on the Ghost's left eye. When this is pressed, an LED is connected to light up when this occurs. When the player ghost dies and is sent back to the middle, the vibration motor inside the controller will activate, providing a form of haptic feedback. 


Drawings
=====================
The drawings outline the two bodies that make up the controller, the cover and the base. The drawings also include the aformentioned parts such as arudino and vibration motor in the drawing, with measurements for the two main components included. They do lack some detail; however, the full drawing includes a view inside the interior of the controller, which houses the arudino and vibration motor. I was unable to provide a measurement for the ghost's full length as Fusion would not let me select certain points on the drawing.

TinkerCAD
=====================
I was unable to complete the TinkerCad circuit functionality; however, the intetion was to show how the button would trigger the LED as described previously in the components section, as well as the vibration motor triggering. Although I am unable to simulate the condition for the vibration motor, it was placed there to show that it is a part of the circuit.
